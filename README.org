** Dependencies
   One of the following is needed for image previews
   | [[https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug][ueberzug]] | Used for image previews in X11     |
   | [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]]    | Kitty's [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat/][icat]] is used if available  |
   | jp2a     | ASCII-art previews in the terminal |
   | [[https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa/][chafa]]    | ANSI-art previews in the terminal  |
   | [[https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa/][chafa]]    | Also used for [[https://www.arewesixelyet.com/][sixel]] *              |

   * Note that sixel doesn't work well under tmux, lf, fzf, and many others. Forks exist like [[https://github.com/horriblename/lf][lf-sixel]], [[https://github.com/csdvrx/sixel-tmux][sixel-tmux]].

   The following programs. Note that the names are the command names and not the package names

   Overall, it should work fine without most dependencies, it will fallback to simpler previews.

** Usage
*** stpv
    Note: stpvimg should be run first as mentioned below for image previews to work
    #+begin_src shell
      stpv $FILE $H $W $X $Y $ID # all arguments except FILE are optional
      stpv --clear $ID # only if stpvimg is running
    #+end_src

*** stpvimg
    #+begin_src shell
      ID=$$
      stpvimg --listen $ID &
      stpvimg --add $ID 1.png
      stpvimg --add $ID 2.png $X $Y $W $H
      stpvimg --clear $ID
      stpvimg --end $ID
    #+end_src

*** Integration with [[https://github.com/Naheel-Azawy/fmz][fmz]]
    ~stpv~ is already integrated with ~fmz~. Just install ~stpv~ and ~fmz~ will use it.

*** Integration with [[https://github.com/gokcehan/lf][lf]]
    lf now support image previews. All what is needed is to add the following to lfrc:
    #+begin_src shell
      set previewer stpv
      set cleaner stpvimgclr
      &stpvimg --listen $id
      cmd on-quit $stpvimg --end $id
    #+end_src

*** Integration with [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]]
    #+begin_src shell
      fzfp
    #+end_src

** Installation
   #+begin_src shell
     sudo make install
   #+end_src

** Configuration
   The configuration file is typically located in ~/.config/stpv/config.sh.
   It is a simple shell script that gets sourced in stpv.

   Options are listed below. Use any string for true, leave empty for false.
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     PV_IMAGE_ENABLED=1        # show image previews when possible
     PV_TYPE=img               # (ueberzug|kitty|sixel|ansi|ascii|img|text)
     PREFER_TEXT=              # prefer text over images when displaying documents
     DARK_DOCS=                # invert documents preview color in image previews
     SAFE=1                    # kill itself if needed (check main for details)
     AUTO_ORIENT=1             # auto orient images
     MAX_IMG_CACHE_SIZE=300kb  # max image cache size
     MAX_IMG_CACHE_W=1920      # max image cached image width
     MAX_IMG_CACHE_H=1080      # max image cached image height
     TIMEOUT=5                 # maximum time in seconds stpv should take, approximately
   #+END_SRC

   The last 3 options control how images are cached.
   Setting them to empty values will improve performance but at the same time might increase cache size.

   Custom previews can be added to your ~config.sh~ file as well.
   Below is an example that shows any file ending with a ~.moo~ in ~cowsay~.

   #+begin_src shell
     #       function    type dep    dep-image
     add_top handle_cows cows cowsay -
     handle_cows() {
         [ "$file_extension_lower" = moo ] ||
             return "$RET_NO_MATCH"

         cowsay < "$file_path"
     }
   #+end_src

   However, if you think you wrote a nice previewer, pull requests are more than welcomed.
   Check the main stpv file for more examples.
